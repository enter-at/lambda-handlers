# lambda-handlers

An opinionated Python package that facilitates specifying AWS Lambda handlers.

It includes input validation, error handling and response formatting.

## Install the latest

To install the latest version of lambda-handlers simply run:

```bash
pip install lambda-handlers
```

If you are going to use validation, we have examples that work with
[Marshmallow](https://pypi.org/project/marshmallow/) or
[jsonschema](https://pypi.org/project/jsonschema/).

But you can adapt a LambdaHandler to use your favourite validation module.
Please share it with us or create an issue if you need any help with that.
